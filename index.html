			<h2 class="content_title">About Me</h2>
			<p class="content_p">My name is Nickolas Santiago. I am a front end developer from the Bronx, New York. I studied
			   New Media Interactive Development at RIT.</p>
			<p class="content_p">A lot of my talent is focused on web development. I am proficient with HTML, CSS, and
			   Javascript. I have worked with creating apps and games using the canvas tag and using a combination of APIs and the
			   AJAX technique. I also have experience with some JavaScript libraries/frameworks including d3, jQuery, and react.</p>
			<p class="content_p">Aside from web development, I have front end experience in Unity3D using C#. I have worked with
	   	       Unity's built-in UI system as well as other aspect's like collisions and triggers. I can confidently work in PhotoShop,
			   Illustrator, 3ds Max and with an Arduino.</p>
			<p class="content_p">When I'm not programming, I'm being a huge theater-nerd. Since starting at RIT, I've been a part
			   of 8 productions as a stage manager, an actor, or a member of the back-stage crew. I've acted in <i>A Midsummer Night's
			   Dream</i>, <i>The Royal Hunt of the Sun</i>, and <i>The Marriage of Bette and Boo</i> where I had to impersonate a
			   strip of bacon for a scene. Theater gives you a way of really getting out of your comfort zone and just have fun.<br>
			   I have been affiliated with the National Hispanic Institute since my early high school days. It's an organization that
			   brings together Hispanic kids from across the US and various Latin American countries a chance to explore and appreciate 
			   their heritage while tackling issues concerning their communities under the model of a mock government. Since being a 
			   delegate myself, I have gone back  number of times as a counselor and recruit new members when I can.</p>
